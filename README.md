# PracticeGame
<p>This is a practice of the creation of a game for my CAS project. I practiced using Github and tried to figure out how the eventual game will be programmed. </p>
<p>Note: Most of this code was copied from a tutorial on how to create a text based game. I did not create this material from scratch myself, merely modified it. The tutorial I used can be found <a href="http://letstalkdata.com/2014/08/how-to-write-a-text-adventure-in-python/">here</a></p>
